Subject: fix: restore original resize performance on macOS

Reverts https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3118293 which
fixed a android only regression but in the process regressed electron window
resize perf wildly on macOS.

This patch should be upstreamed as a conditional revert of the logic in desktop
vs mobile runtimes.  i.e. restore the old logic only on desktop platforms
